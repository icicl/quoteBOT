1
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,534
<i>This is the Asgardian</i>

2
00:00:27,536 --> 00:00:30,005
<i>refugee vessel</i> Statesman.

3
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,009
<i>We are under assault.</i>

4
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:36,409
<i>I repeat, we are under assault.</i>

5
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,979
<i>The engines are dead,
life support failing.</i>

6
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:43,283
<i>Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.</i>

7
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:47,287
<i>We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.</i>

8
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,856
<i>Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.</i>

9
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:51,591
<i>We have very few soldiers here.</i>

10
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,560
<i>This is not a warcraft.</i>

11
00:00:53,562 --> 00:00:55,564
<i>I repeat, this is not a warcraft.</i>

12
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,947
Hear me and rejoice.

13
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,051
You have had the privilege

14
00:01:18,053 --> 00:01:20,789
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

15
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,927
You may think
this is suffering.

16
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:28,295
No.

17
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,600
It is salvation.

18
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:39,338
Universal scales
tip toward balance

19
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,942
because of your sacrifice.

20
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,044
Smile.

21
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,513
For even in death,

22
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:49,885
you have become
Children of Thanos.

23
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:07,468
I know what it's like to lose.

24
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:12,573
To feel so desperately
that you're right...

25
00:02:13,374 --> 00:02:15,977
yet to fail, nonetheless.

26
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:25,753
It's frightening.

27
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:28,990
Turns the legs to jelly.

28
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,394
But I ask you, to what end?

29
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:37,398
Dread it, run from it...

30
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:40,868
destiny arrives all the same.

31
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:43,904
And now, it's here.

32
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:46,440
Or should I say...

33
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,343
I am.

34
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:55,950
You talk too much.

35
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:59,051
The Tesseract.

36
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,355
Or your brother's head.

37
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:08,395
I assume you have
a preference.

38
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:10,896
Oh, I do.

39
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,368
Kill away.

40
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:30,684
All right, stop!

41
00:03:34,154 --> 00:03:36,455
We don't have the Tesseract.

42
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:38,092
It was destroyed on Asgard.

43
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,839
You really are
the worst brother.

44
00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:58,944
I assure you, brother...

45
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:01,014
the sun will shine
on us again.

46
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:06,151
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.

47
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:10,255
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

48
00:04:10,257 --> 00:04:11,457
And for another...

49
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:15,060
we have a Hulk.

50
00:04:26,273 --> 00:04:29,044
- Let him have his fun.

51
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:22,862
Allfathers...

52
00:05:24,764 --> 00:05:27,967
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

53
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:29,902
time.

54
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:46,152
That was a mistake.

55
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:53,793
No!

56
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:05,605
You're going to die for that.

57
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,876
Shh.

58
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:18,617
My humble personage...

59
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:22,188
bows before your grandeur.

60
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:29,126
No other being
has ever had the might...

61
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:31,162
nay, the nobility...

62
00:06:31,164 --> 00:06:35,935
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

63
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:43,842
The universe lies
within your grasp.

64
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:25,851
There are two more stones
on Earth.

65
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:31,054
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

66
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:32,722
Father,
we will not fail you.

67
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:35,258
If I might interject.

68
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,430
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

69
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:42,265
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

70
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,767
If you consider
failure experience.

71
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:47,372
I consider
experience experience.

72
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,373
Almighty Thanos...

73
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:55,113
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

74
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,118
Odinson...

75
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:05,991
the rightful king
of Jotunheim...

76
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:08,393
god of mischief...

77
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:10,896
do hereby pledge to you...

78
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,134
my undying fidelity.

79
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:28,180
Undying?

80
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:35,185
You should choose your words
more carefully.

81
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:57,175
You...

82
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,944
will never be...

83
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:03,814
a god.

84
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:15,059
No!

85
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,444
No resurrections this time.

86
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:58,269
No. Loki.

87
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:40,175
Seriously,
you don't have any money?

88
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:43,345
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

89
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:44,913
I'll tell the guys
at the deli.

90
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:46,948
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

91
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,950
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.

92
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,085
Dollars?

93
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:52,021
- Rupees.
- Which is?

94
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:53,488
- Uh, buck and a half.

95
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,357
What do you want?

96
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,494
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.

97
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:12,043
Thanos is coming.

98
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:13,876
He's coming.

99
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:19,249
Who?

100
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:29,391
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.

101
00:11:29,393 --> 00:11:30,559
You're totally rambling.

102
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:31,493
-  No, I'm not.
-  You lost me.

103
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:32,927
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,

104
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,161
and in the dream
you gotta pee.

105
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:35,297
- Yeah.
- Okay.

106
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:36,264
And then you're like...
"Oh, my God.

107
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,666
there's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?

108
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:38,933
Oh! someone's watching.
Right.

109
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:40,001
Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."

110
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,135
And then you wake up
and in real life

111
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:42,236
you actually have to pee.

112
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:43,305
- Yes.
- Yeah.

113
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:44,539
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.

114
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,575
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

115
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:50,581
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.

116
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:52,714
It was so real.

117
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:54,248
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.

118
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,383
Uh, what was his name?

119
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:57,719
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.

120
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:59,554
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.

121
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:01,355
...and thought that we were...

122
00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:02,524
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

123
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:03,391
- Yes?
- No.

124
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:05,226
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.

125
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:07,228
If you wanted to have a kid...

126
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,296
you wouldn't have done that.

127
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:11,332
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

128
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:13,001
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.

129
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:14,402
You're not helping
your case, okay?

130
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:15,637
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...

131
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,471
You don't need that.

132
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:18,607
I know, I had the surgery.

133
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:20,008
I'm just
trying to protect us...

134
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,643
and future usses
and that's it.

135
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:23,377
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.

136
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,314
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.

137
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,482
You know me so well.

138
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:31,686
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.

139
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,589
You should have shirts
in your closet.

140
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,757
Yeah.

141
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,658
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

142
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,160
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.

143
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:41,295
- Show off this Harry Winston.

144
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:43,697
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

145
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:45,065
I should promise you.

146
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:46,302
- Yes.
- I will.

147
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:49,770
Thank you.

148
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:50,971
Tony Stark.

149
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:54,243
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

150
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:59,047
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.

151
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:01,016
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?

152
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:03,184
We need your help.

153
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:04,718
It's not overselling it
to say that

154
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,520
the fate of the universe
is at stake.

155
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:08,057
And who's "we"?

156
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,026
Hey, Tony.

157
00:13:11,028 --> 00:13:12,159
Bruce.

158
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:13,663
- Pepper.
- Hi.

159
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,367
- Oh.
- You okay?

160
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:22,403
At the dawn
of the universe,

161
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:24,373
there was nothing. Then...

162
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:26,540
Boom.

163
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:30,144
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...

164
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:33,015
hurtling across
the virgin universe.

165
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,549
These Infinity Stones

166
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:38,488
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

167
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,590
Space.

168
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:43,025
Reality.

169
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:45,661
Power.

170
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:48,163
Soul.

171
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:50,399
Mind.

172
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:53,536
And Time.

173
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:04,478
Tell me his name again.

174
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,779
Thanos.

175
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:07,280
He's a plague, Tony.

176
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:09,315
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

177
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:11,552
He wipes out
half the population.

178
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:13,821
He sent Loki.

179
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:16,759
The attack on New York,
that's him.

180
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:18,527
This is it.

181
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:20,628
What's our timeline?

182
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,229
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.

183
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,163
That already makes him

184
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:25,866
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

185
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:29,402
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

186
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:30,537
He could destroy life

187
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,706
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.

188
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,708
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

189
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,877
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

190
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,513
- Is that what it is?

191
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:43,218
I'm going to allow that.

192
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:46,820
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

193
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:48,454
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

194
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:49,689
No can do.

195
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:52,492
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

196
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:53,760
And I swore off dairy...

197
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:56,396
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.

198
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:57,898
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.

199
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,532
A bit chalky.

200
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,301
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.

201
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:02,468
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.

202
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,570
Point is, things change.

203
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:06,673
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

204
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:08,841
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

205
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:09,742
Yeah, so conversely,

206
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:11,878
it may also be
his best chance against us.

207
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,513
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

208
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:14,581
What is your job exactly?

209
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,284
Besides making
balloon animals.

210
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:20,153
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.

211
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:22,689
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

212
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:24,657
The fact is
we have this stone.

213
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,392
We know where it is.

214
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:28,795
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

215
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,565
and we have to find him now.

216
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,799
Yeah, that's the thing.

217
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:33,800
What do you mean?

218
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:36,336
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.

219
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:37,503
He's offline.

220
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:38,838
- What?
- Yeah.

221
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,907
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?

222
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:43,443
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

223
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:44,813
Who could find Vision then?

224
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,549
Shit.

225
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:50,683
Probably Steve Rogers.

226
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:51,820
Oh, great.

227
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:53,555
Maybe.

228
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,255
But...

229
00:15:58,627 --> 00:15:59,728
Call him.

230
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:02,829
It's not that easy.

231
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,797
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?

232
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,865
No.

233
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:07,602
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

234
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,370
Broke up?

235
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,338
Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?

236
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,275
Cap and I fell out hard.

237
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,411
We're not on speaking terms.

238
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,382
Tony, listen to me.

239
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,718
Thor's gone.

240
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,518
Thanos is coming.

241
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,389
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

242
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:46,607
Flip phone.

243
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:08,928
Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be

244
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,264
moving your hair, would ya?

245
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:13,465
Not at the moment, no.

246
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:47,835
- You okay?

247
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:50,068
- Help him!
- Banner!

248
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,870
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!

249
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:52,938
Friday, what am I looking at?

250
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,573
<i>Not sure.
I'm working on it</i>

251
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,675
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone

252
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:57,976
in your back pocket, Doc!

253
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:59,346
Might wanna use it.

254
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:29,074
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

255
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:30,809
Holy shit.

256
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:32,510
We're all gonna die!

257
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:33,812
There's a spaceship!

258
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:35,647
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

259
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,356
What's the matter
with you kids?

260
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,994
You never seen
a spaceship before?

261
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,739
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.

262
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,874
Notify first responders.

263
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,012
<i>Will do.</i>

264
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,441
Hear me and rejoice.

265
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,176
You are about to die

266
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,477
at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

267
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,048
- Be thankful...

268
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,983
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...

269
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,919
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.

270
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,822
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

271
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,891
Stonekeeper.

272
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,427
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?

273
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,629
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.

274
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,967
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

275
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,667
He means get lost, Squidward.

276
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,869
He exhausts me.

277
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,971
- Bring me the stone.

278
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:09,976
Banner, you want a piece?

279
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,543
Mmm, no, not really.

280
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,911
But when do I ever get
what I want?

281
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:14,914
That's right.

282
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:16,981
Okay. Push!

283
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,682
It's been a while.

284
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,217
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.

285
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,384
Okay. Shh.

286
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,221
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.

287
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,723
Come on, come on, man.

288
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,927
- God!

289
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:30,493
Where's your guy?

290
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,197
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.

291
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,565
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.

292
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,001
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.

293
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,308
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

294
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,576
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.

295
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,543
It's okay.

296
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:50,080
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

297
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,549
- I have him.
- Damn it.

298
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,576
Where'd that come from?

299
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:21,644
It's nanotech.

300
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,046
You like it?
A little something I...

301
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,818
Doctor Banner, if the rest
of your green friend

302
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,021
won't be joining us...

303
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:41,031
Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.

304
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,532
It stays with me.

305
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:43,535
Exactly. Bye.

306
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,644
Tony, you okay?

307
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,679
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- <i>Really, really good.</i>

308
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:57,914
<i>Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?</i>

309
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,150
I'm trying. He won't come out.

310
00:22:01,052 --> 00:22:02,120
Hammer.

311
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,962
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?

312
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,198
Come out! Come out! Come out!

313
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,569
No!

314
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:23,108
What do you mean, "no"?

315
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:30,747
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?

316
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,585
- Kid, where'd you come from?
- A field trip to MoMA.

317
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,260
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?

318
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:38,988
Uh, he's from space.

319
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,224
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.

320
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,819
Your powers are quaint.

321
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,622
You must be popular
with children.

322
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,359
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

323
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,794
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

324
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:36,778
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.

325
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,414
You'll only wish
you were dead.

326
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:49,726
No!

327
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:55,398
Kid,
that's the wizard. Get on it.

328
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,035
On it!

329
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,876
Not cool.

330
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,081
Gotcha!

331
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:13,250
Wait!

332
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:24,092
Uh, Mr. Stark,
I'm being beamed up.

333
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:25,329
Hang on, kid.

334
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:42,379
- Oh!

335
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:45,280
Ugh.

336
00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:47,084
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.

337
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:55,925
Give me a little juice,
Friday.

338
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,168
Unlock 17:A.

339
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:20,949
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

340
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:23,318
But you said
save the wizard!

341
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,419
I can't breathe.

342
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:27,291
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

343
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:30,460
Yeah. That makes sense.

344
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,944
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!

345
00:25:49,946 --> 00:25:50,945
Happy trails, kid.

346
00:25:50,947 --> 00:25:52,468
Friday, send him home.
<i>Yep.</i>

347
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,917
Oh, come on!

348
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,393
<i>Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.</i>

349
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:06,428
<i>Tony? Oh, my God.</i>

350
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,495
<i>Are you all right?
What's going on?</i>

351
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:08,563
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think

352
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:10,398
we might have to push
our 8:30 res.

353
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,533
<i>Why?</i>

354
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:13,200
Just 'cause
I'll probably

355
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:15,803
not make it back for a while.

356
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:17,071
<i>Tell me
you're not on that ship.</i>

357
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:18,340
Yeah.

358
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:19,541
<i>God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.</i>

359
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:21,343
Honey, I'm sorry.

360
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:22,377
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

361
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:24,078
<i>Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.</i>

362
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,247
- Pep.
- <i>Come back here right now.</i>

363
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:27,281
<i>Come back.</i>

364
00:26:27,283 --> 00:26:30,050
<i>Boss,
we're losing her.</i>

365
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:31,488
I'm going too.

366
00:26:40,564 --> 00:26:41,964
Oh, my God!

367
00:26:46,335 --> 00:26:48,304
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

368
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:04,318
Where you going?

369
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,953
The Time Stone's been taken.

370
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:07,890
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

371
00:27:08,391 --> 00:27:09,959
What will you do?

372
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:12,328
I'm gonna make a call.

373
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:53,902
Sing it, Drax!

374
00:28:06,382 --> 00:28:08,015
Why are we doing this again?

375
00:28:08,017 --> 00:28:09,583
It's a distress signal,
Rocket.

376
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:10,917
Someone could be dying.

377
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,119
I get that,
but why are we doing it?

378
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:15,088
'Cause we're nice.

379
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,155
And maybe whoever it is

380
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:18,025
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.

381
00:28:18,027 --> 00:28:20,427
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.

382
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:22,329
I mean,
if he doesn't pony up...

383
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:23,497
We take his ship.

384
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:25,299
- Exactly!
- Bingo!

385
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:26,302
All right!

386
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:31,438
We are arriving.

387
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,506
All right, Guardians,

388
00:28:32,508 --> 00:28:33,940
don't forget
this might be dangerous...

389
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:36,177
so let's put on
our mean faces.

390
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:43,082
Groot, put that
thing away, now.

391
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:44,150
I don't wanna tell you again.

392
00:28:44,152 --> 00:28:45,385
- Groot.

393
00:28:45,387 --> 00:28:46,553
I am Groot!

394
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:47,654
- Whoa!
- Language!

395
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:49,255
- Hey!
- Wow.

396
00:28:49,257 --> 00:28:51,124
You got some
acorns on you, kid.

397
00:28:51,126 --> 00:28:52,626
Ever since
you got a little sap,

398
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:54,595
you're a total d-hole.

399
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:57,999
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.

400
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,374
What happened?

401
00:29:10,412 --> 00:29:11,680
Oh, my God.

402
00:29:17,352 --> 00:29:19,154
Looks like
we're not getting paid.

403
00:29:21,356 --> 00:29:23,456
Wipers! Wipers!

404
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,692
Get it off.

405
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:34,367
How the hell
is this dude still alive?

406
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:36,335
He is not a dude.

407
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:38,237
You're a dude.

408
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:41,574
This... This is a man.

409
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:44,510
A handsome, muscular man.

410
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:45,578
I'm muscular.

411
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,646
But who are you
kidding, Quill?

412
00:29:46,648 --> 00:29:48,214
You're one sandwich
away from fat.

413
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:49,215
Yeah, right.

414
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:50,750
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

415
00:29:50,752 --> 00:29:51,952
What?

416
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:56,057
Gamora, do you think I'm...

417
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:02,094
He is anxious, angry.

418
00:30:02,096 --> 00:30:05,698
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.

419
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,568
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

420
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,535
Wow.

421
00:30:09,537 --> 00:30:11,737
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.

422
00:30:11,739 --> 00:30:14,640
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

423
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:15,708
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

424
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,343
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

425
00:30:17,345 --> 00:30:18,578
It's like his muscles

426
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,646
are made
of Cotati metal fibers.

427
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:22,417
Stop massaging his muscles.

428
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:25,253
Wake him up.

429
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:29,589
Wake.

430
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:49,209
Who the hell are you guys?

431
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:55,681
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

432
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:57,517
To bring balance
to the universe

433
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,586
by wiping out
half of all life.

434
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:02,822
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

435
00:31:02,824 --> 00:31:04,556
massacre by massacre.

436
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:06,191
Including my own.

437
00:31:06,193 --> 00:31:07,793
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...

438
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:11,162
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

439
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:13,766
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

440
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:17,604
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.

441
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:23,710
Your father killed my brother.

442
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:25,477
Oh, boy.

443
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,345
Stepfather, technically.

444
00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:29,283
And she hates him
as much as you do.

445
00:31:32,854 --> 00:31:34,619
Families can be tough.

446
00:31:34,621 --> 00:31:36,154
Before my father died,

447
00:31:36,156 --> 00:31:37,890
he told me
that I had a half-sister...

448
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:40,425
that he imprisoned in Hel.

449
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:43,528
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

450
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,897
So I had to kill her.

451
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:47,198
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

452
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,402
Goes round and round and...

453
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:50,402
I feel your pain.

454
00:31:50,404 --> 00:31:52,771
I feel your pain as well,
because...

455
00:31:52,773 --> 00:31:54,172
I mean,
it's not a competition,

456
00:31:54,174 --> 00:31:55,407
but I've been through a lot.

457
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:57,275
- My father killed my mother.

458
00:31:57,277 --> 00:31:58,443
And then I had to kill
my father.

459
00:31:58,445 --> 00:32:00,178
- That was hard.

460
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,515
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

461
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:06,551
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

462
00:32:06,553 --> 00:32:08,322
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

463
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,692
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

464
00:32:13,694 --> 00:32:16,394
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

465
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:19,764
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

466
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:22,469
No, you're not.

467
00:32:24,404 --> 00:32:28,707
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

468
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:32,211
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

469
00:32:33,947 --> 00:32:35,780
- No.
- You are.

470
00:32:35,782 --> 00:32:38,683
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

471
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:40,184
No, I'm not.

472
00:32:40,186 --> 00:32:42,188
He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

473
00:32:48,327 --> 00:32:49,694
Are you mocking me?

474
00:32:49,696 --> 00:32:53,230
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

475
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:54,298
He's trying to copy me.

476
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,432
I need you to stop doing that.

477
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:57,267
Enough!
- He's doing it first.

478
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:58,703
We need to stop Thanos.

479
00:32:58,705 --> 00:33:00,404
Which means
we need to find out

480
00:33:00,406 --> 00:33:01,539
where he's going next.

481
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:02,874
Knowhere.

482
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:04,743
He must be going somewhere.

483
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:06,878
No, no. Knowhere?

484
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,748
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

485
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,617
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

486
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:15,887
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

487
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:17,354
Because for years...

488
00:33:17,356 --> 00:33:19,556
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

489
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:21,225
with a man
called the Collector.

490
00:33:21,227 --> 00:33:22,827
If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

491
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:24,729
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

492
00:33:24,731 --> 00:33:26,363
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...

493
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:28,933
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

494
00:33:28,935 --> 00:33:31,568
There are six stones
out there.

495
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,872
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

496
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:37,675
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

497
00:33:37,677 --> 00:33:39,844
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

498
00:33:39,846 --> 00:33:42,713
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

499
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:44,481
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

500
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:45,749
They're with the Avengers.

501
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:48,285
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

502
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:49,520
Like Kevin Bacon?

503
00:33:49,522 --> 00:33:50,821
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

504
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:51,889
I haven't been there
in a while.

505
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:54,458
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

506
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,293
No one even knows where it is.

507
00:33:56,295 --> 00:33:57,962
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

508
00:33:57,964 --> 00:33:59,663
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

509
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:02,332
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

510
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:03,500
You're welcome.

511
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:04,802
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

512
00:34:04,804 --> 00:34:08,906
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

513
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:10,908
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

514
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,311
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

515
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:15,946
That place is a legend.

516
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:17,548
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

517
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,717
to ever torment the universe.

518
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,885
I would very much like
to go there, please.

519
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:22,953
The rabbit is correct

520
00:34:22,955 --> 00:34:24,054
and clearly the smartest
among you.

521
00:34:24,056 --> 00:34:25,089
Rabbit?

522
00:34:25,091 --> 00:34:27,758
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

523
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,059
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

524
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:30,394
You're very perceptive.

525
00:34:30,396 --> 00:34:31,628
You seem like a noble leader.

526
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,430
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

527
00:34:33,432 --> 00:34:36,400
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

528
00:34:36,402 --> 00:34:38,335
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

529
00:34:38,337 --> 00:34:39,503
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

530
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:40,704
Quiet.

531
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:42,372
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.

532
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,008
Look, this is my ship.

533
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,810
And I'm not goin' to...

534
00:34:46,812 --> 00:34:49,013
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

535
00:34:49,015 --> 00:34:51,081
The Thanos-killing kind.

536
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,816
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

537
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:54,985
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

538
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:56,319
Your bodies would crumble

539
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:57,588
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

540
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,656
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

541
00:34:59,658 --> 00:35:00,924
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

542
00:35:00,926 --> 00:35:02,391
If we don't go to Knowhere

543
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:03,994
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

544
00:35:03,996 --> 00:35:05,763
he'll be too powerful to stop.

545
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:08,032
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

546
00:35:08,034 --> 00:35:09,867
We got two ships

547
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:11,501
and a large assortment
of morons.

548
00:35:11,503 --> 00:35:14,838
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

549
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,040
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

550
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:17,841
to try to stop Thanos.

551
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:19,910
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

552
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:21,945
For the record...

553
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:23,479
I know that
you're going with him

554
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:24,681
because it's where
Thanos isn't.

555
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:26,349
You know, you really shouldn't

556
00:35:26,351 --> 00:35:28,453
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

557
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,121
Come on, Groot.

558
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:33,957
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

559
00:35:37,662 --> 00:35:40,663
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.

560
00:35:40,665 --> 00:35:41,766
Bye.

561
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:58,049
Vis?

562
00:35:58,051 --> 00:36:00,117
Is it the stone again?

563
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,820
It's as if
it's speaking to me.

564
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,023
What does it say?

565
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:07,492
I don't... I don't know,
but something.

566
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,862
- Hey.

567
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:23,341
Tell me what you feel.

568
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,917
I just feel you.

569
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:43,125
So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...

570
00:36:43,127 --> 00:36:45,461
which would give us more time
together before you went back.

571
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:46,963
What if
I miss that train?

572
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:48,097
There's an 11:00.

573
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:50,635
What if I missed
all the trains?

574
00:36:51,936 --> 00:36:53,836
What if this time
I didn't go back?

575
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:55,438
But you gave Stark your word.

576
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,606
I'd rather give it to you.

577
00:36:56,608 --> 00:36:58,808
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.

578
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,209
We both made promises.

579
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:01,980
Not to each other.

580
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:04,480
Wanda.

581
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:06,883
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...

582
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:09,051
trying to see
if this could work and...

583
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:10,853
I don't know.

584
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:12,889
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.

585
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:14,857
I think...

586
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:16,058
- It works.
- It works.

587
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,494
It works.

588
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:21,065
Stay.

589
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:23,735
Stay with me.

590
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,743
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

591
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:40,850
What are they?

592
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:43,187
What the stone
was warning me about.

593
00:37:53,164 --> 00:37:54,696
I have to go.

594
00:37:54,698 --> 00:37:56,198
No, Vision.

595
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,666
Vision, if that's true,

596
00:37:57,668 --> 00:38:00,504
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.

597
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:02,737
Wanda, I...

598
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,775
- Vision!

599
00:38:32,903 --> 00:38:36,571
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.

600
00:38:36,573 --> 00:38:38,574
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

601
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:42,110
My systems are failing.

602
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,848
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

603
00:38:47,285 --> 00:38:48,485
Vis!

604
00:38:57,561 --> 00:39:00,929
Give up the stone,
and she lives.

605
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:40,137
Hands off.

606
00:39:55,986 --> 00:39:57,318
Come on. Come on.

607
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,287
Come on, you gotta get up.

608
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:01,657
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.

609
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:04,359
Hey. We have to go.

610
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:08,762
Please. Please leave.

611
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:10,599
You asked me to stay.

612
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:12,935
- I'm staying.
- Please.

613
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,007
- Get up.
- I can't.

614
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:28,909
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.

615
00:41:28,911 --> 00:41:31,047
You'll never get
the chance again.

616
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,929
Can you stand?

617
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:54,803
Thank you, Captain.

618
00:41:57,373 --> 00:41:59,074
Let's get you on the jet.

619
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:06,513
Now, I thought we had a deal.

620
00:42:06,515 --> 00:42:10,417
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

621
00:42:10,419 --> 00:42:12,020
I'm sorry.

622
00:42:12,022 --> 00:42:13,855
We just wanted time.

623
00:42:16,425 --> 00:42:17,825
Where to, Cap?

624
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,097
Home.

625
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:27,867
We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.

626
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:53,427
<i>Zehobereians.</i>

627
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:55,362
Mother! Where's my mother?

628
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,963
<i>Choose a side or die.</i>

629
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:58,465
Mother!

630
00:42:58,467 --> 00:43:00,933
<i>One side
is a revelation...</i>

631
00:43:00,935 --> 00:43:03,972
<i>the other an honor
known only to a few.</i>

632
00:43:04,906 --> 00:43:06,973
What's wrong, little one?

633
00:43:06,975 --> 00:43:10,311
My mother. Where is my mother?

634
00:43:15,149 --> 00:43:16,317
What's your name?

635
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:19,919
Gamora.

636
00:43:19,921 --> 00:43:22,024
You're quite the fighter,
Gamora.

637
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:24,957
Come.

638
00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:25,960
Let me help you.

639
00:43:39,374 --> 00:43:40,475
Look.

640
00:43:44,212 --> 00:43:46,545
Pretty, isn't it?

641
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:50,249
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

642
00:43:50,251 --> 00:43:54,055
Too much to one side
or the other...

643
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:00,928
Here. You try.

644
00:44:04,532 --> 00:44:07,801
<i>Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.</i>

645
00:44:09,203 --> 00:44:11,072
- Uh-uh.

646
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:14,507
Concentrate.

647
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:20,248
There. You've got it.

648
00:44:29,657 --> 00:44:30,924
Gamora.

649
00:44:31,992 --> 00:44:33,059
Do you know if these grenades

650
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:35,394
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?

651
00:44:35,396 --> 00:44:36,529
Because I was thinking about

652
00:44:36,531 --> 00:44:38,264
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.

653
00:44:38,266 --> 00:44:39,398
But I don't want to
if they're the...

654
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,601
I need to ask a favor.

655
00:44:41,536 --> 00:44:43,004
Yeah, sure.

656
00:44:44,439 --> 00:44:45,571
One way or another,

657
00:44:45,573 --> 00:44:47,974
the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.

658
00:44:49,577 --> 00:44:52,110
Which is what
the grenades are for.

659
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:54,382
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?

660
00:44:56,651 --> 00:44:57,851
If things go wrong...

661
00:44:59,354 --> 00:45:01,456
If Thanos gets me...

662
00:45:06,093 --> 00:45:08,061
I want you to promise me...

663
00:45:09,096 --> 00:45:10,197
you'll kill me.

664
00:45:10,997 --> 00:45:11,998
What?

665
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,438
I know something he doesn't.

666
00:45:20,073 --> 00:45:22,307
And if he finds it out,

667
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:23,749
the entire universe
could be at risk.

668
00:45:24,344 --> 00:45:25,544
What do you know?

669
00:45:25,546 --> 00:45:27,582
If I tell you, you'd know too.

670
00:45:30,618 --> 00:45:32,551
If it's so important...

671
00:45:32,553 --> 00:45:33,719
shouldn't I?

672
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:34,886
Only if you wanna die.

673
00:45:34,888 --> 00:45:37,008
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

674
00:45:38,225 --> 00:45:39,226
Just...

675
00:45:41,561 --> 00:45:44,697
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.

676
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:47,298
I mean, I'd like to.

677
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,300
- I really would. But you...

678
00:45:49,302 --> 00:45:50,470
Swear to me.

679
00:45:54,074 --> 00:45:56,309
Swear to me on your mother.

680
00:46:03,316 --> 00:46:04,317
Okay.

681
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:11,491
Okay.

682
00:46:27,674 --> 00:46:28,773
- Oh.
- Dude.

683
00:46:28,775 --> 00:46:30,475
How long have you been
standing there?

684
00:46:30,477 --> 00:46:31,478
An hour.

685
00:46:32,112 --> 00:46:33,313
An hour?

686
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:35,313
Are you serious?

687
00:46:35,315 --> 00:46:37,515
I've mastered the ability

688
00:46:37,517 --> 00:46:40,253
of standing
so incredibly still...

689
00:46:41,421 --> 00:46:44,090
that I become
invisible to the eye.

690
00:46:44,591 --> 00:46:45,592
Watch.

691
00:46:49,529 --> 00:46:51,563
You're eating a zarg-nut.

692
00:46:51,565 --> 00:46:53,098
But my movement...

693
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:55,469
was so slow...

694
00:46:56,336 --> 00:46:58,336
that it's imperceptible.

695
00:46:58,338 --> 00:46:59,204
Mmm, no.

696
00:46:59,206 --> 00:47:01,806
I'm sure I'm invisible.

697
00:47:01,808 --> 00:47:03,142
Hi, Drax.

698
00:47:05,712 --> 00:47:06,713
Damn it.

699
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:28,566
This place looks deserted.

700
00:47:28,568 --> 00:47:31,503
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

701
00:47:31,505 --> 00:47:33,439
Yep,
I'm picking that up too.

702
00:47:34,774 --> 00:47:36,342
Let's put down right here.

703
00:47:48,153 --> 00:47:49,589
I don't have it.

704
00:47:51,691 --> 00:47:53,524
Everyone
in the galaxy knows

705
00:47:53,526 --> 00:47:55,192
you'd sell your own brother...

706
00:47:55,194 --> 00:47:56,828
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...

707
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,765
to your pathetic collection.

708
00:48:06,605 --> 00:48:10,107
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.

709
00:48:10,109 --> 00:48:13,479
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

710
00:48:16,682 --> 00:48:18,350
I told you.

711
00:48:19,184 --> 00:48:20,185
I sold it.

712
00:48:22,889 --> 00:48:25,222
Why would I lie?

713
00:48:25,224 --> 00:48:27,393
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

714
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,160
Like suicide.

715
00:48:30,162 --> 00:48:32,529
You do understand.

716
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:35,666
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

717
00:48:35,668 --> 00:48:37,467
I didn't know what it was.

718
00:48:37,469 --> 00:48:40,437
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

719
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:41,572
It's him.

720
00:48:41,574 --> 00:48:43,206
Last chance, charlatan.

721
00:48:44,577 --> 00:48:46,677
Where's the stone?

722
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:48,211
Today...

723
00:48:48,213 --> 00:48:49,313
Drax. Drax.

724
00:48:49,315 --> 00:48:51,381
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

725
00:48:51,383 --> 00:48:52,418
Drax, wait.

726
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:55,452
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

727
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:56,655
Drax.

728
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,893
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.

729
00:49:02,895 --> 00:49:05,429
He doesn't have the stone yet.

730
00:49:05,431 --> 00:49:07,798
If we get it,
then we can stop him.

731
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,268
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

732
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:12,469
No.

733
00:49:12,471 --> 00:49:15,872
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

734
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:17,309
Sleep.

735
00:49:29,253 --> 00:49:30,386
Okay.

736
00:49:30,388 --> 00:49:34,460
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

737
00:49:35,761 --> 00:49:37,161
The other right.

738
00:50:01,419 --> 00:50:03,187
Why?

739
00:50:12,998 --> 00:50:17,235
Why you, daughter?

740
00:50:35,753 --> 00:50:36,754
That was quick.

741
00:50:42,593 --> 00:50:47,498
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!

742
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:52,537
Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?

743
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,242
<i>In my heart,
I knew you still cared.</i>

744
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,753
<i>But one never knows for sure.</i>

745
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:20,798
<i>Reality is often
disappointing.</i>

746
00:51:23,935 --> 00:51:26,337
That is, it was.

747
00:51:28,372 --> 00:51:29,674
Now...

748
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:34,512
reality can be
whatever I want.

749
00:51:35,947 --> 00:51:37,646
You knew I'd come.

750
00:51:37,648 --> 00:51:39,982
I counted on it.

751
00:51:39,984 --> 00:51:42,920
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

752
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:49,392
Thanos!

753
00:51:56,868 --> 00:51:57,902
No!

754
00:52:02,405 --> 00:52:04,439
Let her go, Grimace.

755
00:52:04,441 --> 00:52:05,442
Peter.

756
00:52:06,811 --> 00:52:08,013
I told you to go right.

757
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:10,112
Now? Really?

758
00:52:10,114 --> 00:52:11,981
You let her go!

759
00:52:11,983 --> 00:52:13,883
- Ah, the boyfriend.

760
00:52:13,885 --> 00:52:15,018
No.

761
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,417
Like to think of myself

762
00:52:16,419 --> 00:52:18,921
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

763
00:52:18,923 --> 00:52:21,090
- Let her go.
- Peter.

764
00:52:21,092 --> 00:52:25,863
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.

765
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:27,932
Not him.

766
00:52:38,508 --> 00:52:42,079
You promised. You promised.

767
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:47,949
Oh, daughter.

768
00:52:47,951 --> 00:52:50,554
You expect too much from him.

769
00:52:54,026 --> 00:52:55,692
She's asked, hasn't she?

770
00:52:59,663 --> 00:53:00,664
Do it.

771
00:53:04,534 --> 00:53:05,735
Mmm.

772
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,471
- Do it!

773
00:53:15,078 --> 00:53:16,613
I told you to go right.

774
00:53:18,582 --> 00:53:21,551
I love you more than anything.

775
00:53:24,654 --> 00:53:26,056
I love you too.

776
00:53:40,503 --> 00:53:41,538
I like him.

777
00:54:12,036 --> 00:54:14,168
<i>Still no word from Vision?</i>

778
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,571
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

779
00:54:17,573 --> 00:54:18,806
<i>On a stolen Quinjet</i>

780
00:54:18,808 --> 00:54:20,875
<i>with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.</i>

781
00:54:20,877 --> 00:54:22,609
You know they're
only criminals because

782
00:54:22,611 --> 00:54:24,145
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?

783
00:54:24,147 --> 00:54:25,280
<i>My God, Rhodes.</i>

784
00:54:25,282 --> 00:54:28,883
<i>Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.</i>

785
00:54:28,885 --> 00:54:30,051
If it weren't
for those Accords,

786
00:54:30,053 --> 00:54:32,153
Vision would've been
right here.

787
00:54:32,155 --> 00:54:35,524
<i>I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.</i>

788
00:54:35,926 --> 00:54:36,926
That's right.

789
00:54:38,929 --> 00:54:40,929
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.

790
00:54:40,931 --> 00:54:42,230
<i>You have second thoughts?</i>

791
00:54:42,232 --> 00:54:44,001
Not anymore.

792
00:54:49,872 --> 00:54:51,540
Mr. Secretary.

793
00:54:55,978 --> 00:54:57,713
<i>You got some nerve.</i>

794
00:54:58,248 --> 00:55:00,081
<i>I'll give you that.</i>

795
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:01,884
You could use
some of that right now.

796
00:55:02,751 --> 00:55:05,786
<i>The world's on fire.</i>

797
00:55:05,788 --> 00:55:09,523
<i>And you think all is forgiven?</i>

798
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:11,292
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

799
00:55:11,294 --> 00:55:13,595
And I'm way past
asking permission.

800
00:55:15,564 --> 00:55:17,998
Earth just lost
her best defender.

801
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:19,168
So we're here to fight.

802
00:55:20,836 --> 00:55:22,771
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

803
00:55:23,772 --> 00:55:25,708
we'll fight you too.

804
00:55:28,911 --> 00:55:29,912
<i>Arrest them.</i>

805
00:55:31,014 --> 00:55:32,681
All over it.

806
00:55:37,753 --> 00:55:39,054
That's a court-martial.

807
00:55:41,623 --> 00:55:42,703
It's great to see you, Cap.

808
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:45,592
- You too, Rhodey.

809
00:55:45,594 --> 00:55:46,595
Hey.

810
00:55:47,863 --> 00:55:50,099
Wow. You guys...

811
00:55:50,966 --> 00:55:53,100
really look like crap.

812
00:55:53,102 --> 00:55:54,901
Must've been
a rough couple years.

813
00:55:54,903 --> 00:55:58,006
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

814
00:55:58,008 --> 00:56:00,142
Uh, I think
you look great.

815
00:56:03,612 --> 00:56:04,680
Uh...

816
00:56:07,216 --> 00:56:09,251
Yeah, I'm back.

817
00:56:10,986 --> 00:56:11,987
Hi, Bruce.

818
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:18,626
Nat.

819
00:56:21,964 --> 00:56:23,598
This is awkward.

820
00:56:26,002 --> 00:56:27,768
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

821
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,037
And they can clearly find us.

822
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:31,637
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

823
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,106
After the whole
Accords situation,

824
00:56:33,108 --> 00:56:34,841
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough

825
00:56:34,843 --> 00:56:36,376
on their families.
They're on house arrest.

826
00:56:36,378 --> 00:56:37,944
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

827
00:56:37,946 --> 00:56:39,347
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

828
00:56:40,249 --> 00:56:41,281
Okay, look.

829
00:56:41,283 --> 00:56:44,351
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

830
00:56:44,353 --> 00:56:47,890
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

831
00:56:49,757 --> 00:56:50,924
Vision's stone.

832
00:56:50,926 --> 00:56:52,259
Then we have to protect it.

833
00:56:52,261 --> 00:56:53,962
No, we have to destroy it.

834
00:56:56,098 --> 00:56:57,397
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

835
00:56:57,399 --> 00:56:58,731
to this entity in my head.

836
00:56:58,733 --> 00:57:00,766
About its nature.

837
00:57:00,768 --> 00:57:03,037
But also its composition.

838
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:05,105
I think if it were exposed

839
00:57:05,107 --> 00:57:07,107
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

840
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:10,978
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

841
00:57:12,647 --> 00:57:15,215
its molecular integrity
could fail.

842
00:57:15,217 --> 00:57:17,983
Yeah, and you with it.

843
00:57:17,985 --> 00:57:19,685
We're not having
this conversation.

844
00:57:19,687 --> 00:57:21,754
Eliminating the stone
is the only way

845
00:57:21,756 --> 00:57:24,191
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

846
00:57:24,193 --> 00:57:26,361
That's too high a price.

847
00:57:30,965 --> 00:57:33,268
Only you have
the power to pay it.

848
00:57:37,672 --> 00:57:39,839
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

849
00:57:39,841 --> 00:57:42,409
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

850
00:57:42,411 --> 00:57:43,945
But it should.

851
00:57:46,347 --> 00:57:47,980
We don't trade lives, Vision.

852
00:57:47,982 --> 00:57:50,082
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

853
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:52,051
to save how many
millions of people?

854
00:57:52,053 --> 00:57:54,220
Tell me,
why is this any different?

855
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:56,657
Because you might
have a choice.

856
00:57:57,892 --> 00:57:59,225
Your mind is made up

857
00:57:59,227 --> 00:58:01,861
of a complex construct
of overlays.

858
00:58:01,863 --> 00:58:05,464
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

859
00:58:05,466 --> 00:58:07,333
All of them mixed together,

860
00:58:07,335 --> 00:58:09,235
all of them
learning from one another.

861
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:11,170
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

862
00:58:11,172 --> 00:58:14,373
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

863
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:15,975
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

864
00:58:15,977 --> 00:58:17,810
Perhaps the best parts.

865
00:58:17,812 --> 00:58:19,080
Can we do that?

866
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:21,881
Not me, not here.

867
00:58:21,883 --> 00:58:23,382
Well,
you better find someone

868
00:58:23,384 --> 00:58:24,850
and somewhere fast.

869
00:58:24,852 --> 00:58:26,218
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys

870
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,388
have your old rooms back.

871
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,093
I know somewhere.

872
00:58:46,806 --> 00:58:48,073
The Kingsguard

873
00:58:48,075 --> 00:58:49,441
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

874
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,443
And the Border Tribe?

875
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,345
Those that are left.

876
00:58:53,347 --> 00:58:55,780
Send word
to the Jabari as well.

877
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,916
M'Baku likes a good fight.

878
00:59:00,087 --> 00:59:02,354
And what of this one?

879
00:59:02,356 --> 00:59:04,923
This one may be tired of war.

880
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:07,961
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

881
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,152
Where's the fight?

882
00:59:33,086 --> 00:59:34,422
On its way.

883
00:59:52,939 --> 00:59:55,409
In all the time
I've served Thanos...

884
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,312
I have never failed him.

885
01:00:04,384 --> 01:00:07,586
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...

886
01:00:07,588 --> 01:00:09,320
with the Time Stone
still attached

887
01:00:09,322 --> 01:00:11,590
to your vaguely
irritating person...

888
01:00:11,592 --> 01:00:14,261
there would be judgment.

889
01:00:22,936 --> 01:00:24,371
Give me...

890
01:00:28,241 --> 01:00:29,242
the stone.

891
01:00:41,921 --> 01:00:43,187
Wow, you're a seriously

892
01:00:43,189 --> 01:00:44,389
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?

893
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:47,058
Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...

894
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,426
What the...

895
01:00:48,428 --> 01:00:50,128
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

896
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,162
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

897
01:00:51,164 --> 01:00:52,597
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought

898
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:53,498
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.

899
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,565
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.

900
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:57,135
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

901
01:00:57,137 --> 01:00:58,269
God damn it.

902
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:01,239
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

903
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,640
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

904
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:04,208
And now, I'm here in space.

905
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:06,877
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

906
01:01:06,879 --> 01:01:09,080
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

907
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,214
This is a one-way ticket.

908
01:01:10,216 --> 01:01:12,050
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.

909
01:01:12,052 --> 01:01:13,151
No, I did think this through.

910
01:01:13,153 --> 01:01:14,951
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

911
01:01:14,953 --> 01:01:16,487
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

912
01:01:16,489 --> 01:01:18,158
if there's no neighborhood.

913
01:01:20,293 --> 01:01:21,459
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,

914
01:01:21,461 --> 01:01:22,928
but you know
what I'm trying to say.

915
01:01:25,031 --> 01:01:28,932
Come on. We got a situation.

916
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:30,001
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

917
01:01:30,003 --> 01:01:31,068
What's your plan?

918
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:32,205
- Go.
- Um...

919
01:01:32,938 --> 01:01:34,505
Okay, okay... Uh...

920
01:01:34,507 --> 01:01:37,941
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, "<i>Aliens?</i>"

921
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:44,349
Painful, aren't they?

922
01:01:44,351 --> 01:01:48,051
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

923
01:01:48,053 --> 01:01:50,122
- And any one of them...

924
01:01:55,194 --> 01:01:58,029
could end your friend's life
in an instant.

925
01:01:58,031 --> 01:01:59,664
I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.

926
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:02,402
<i>Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.</i>

927
01:02:04,236 --> 01:02:06,937
You've saved nothing.

928
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:09,006
Your powers
are inconsequential

929
01:02:09,008 --> 01:02:10,508
compared to mine.

930
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:12,211
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

931
01:02:26,358 --> 01:02:28,494
Yes! Wait.
What are those?

932
01:02:44,209 --> 01:02:45,978
Hey,
we haven't officially met.

933
01:02:47,212 --> 01:02:48,280
Cool.

934
01:02:50,282 --> 01:02:51,748
We gotta turn
this ship around.

935
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:54,117
Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

936
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:55,552
No, I want to protect
the stone.

937
01:02:55,554 --> 01:02:56,987
And I want you
to thank me.

938
01:02:56,989 --> 01:02:58,522
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

939
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:01,425
For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

940
01:03:01,427 --> 01:03:03,760
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

941
01:03:03,762 --> 01:03:04,628
I seriously don't know

942
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:05,796
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

943
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:08,632
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

944
01:03:08,634 --> 01:03:10,367
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

945
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,436
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

946
01:03:12,438 --> 01:03:14,171
And due to that fact,

947
01:03:14,173 --> 01:03:15,572
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

948
01:03:15,574 --> 01:03:17,441
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

949
01:03:17,443 --> 01:03:19,509
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

950
01:03:19,511 --> 01:03:20,577
The adults are talking.

951
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:23,447
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

952
01:03:23,449 --> 01:03:25,282
What is he, your ward?

953
01:03:25,284 --> 01:03:26,683
No.

954
01:03:26,685 --> 01:03:28,718
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

955
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,489
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

956
01:03:31,457 --> 01:03:33,590
I'm Spider-Man, then.

957
01:03:33,592 --> 01:03:35,258
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

958
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,393
Thing's on autopilot.

959
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,295
Can we control it?

960
01:03:38,297 --> 01:03:40,232
Fly us home?

961
01:03:43,235 --> 01:03:44,367
- Stark?
- Yeah.

962
01:03:44,369 --> 01:03:45,702
Can you get us home?

963
01:03:45,704 --> 01:03:47,104
Yeah, I heard you.

964
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:50,709
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

965
01:03:51,443 --> 01:03:53,108
Under no circumstances

966
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:55,679
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

967
01:03:55,681 --> 01:03:57,079
I don't think
you quite understand

968
01:03:57,081 --> 01:03:58,014
what's at stake here.

969
01:03:58,016 --> 01:04:00,617
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

970
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:03,553
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

971
01:04:03,555 --> 01:04:05,287
Since he sent an army
to New York

972
01:04:05,289 --> 01:04:07,056
and now he's back.

973
01:04:07,058 --> 01:04:09,124
And I don't know what to do.

974
01:04:09,126 --> 01:04:10,259
So I'm not so sure

975
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:12,294
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

976
01:04:12,296 --> 01:04:16,131
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

977
01:04:16,133 --> 01:04:18,434
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

978
01:04:18,436 --> 01:04:21,370
So I say we take
the fight to him.

979
01:04:21,372 --> 01:04:22,373
Doctor.

980
01:04:24,141 --> 01:04:25,677
Do you concur?

981
01:04:28,246 --> 01:04:30,716
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

982
01:04:31,783 --> 01:04:34,149
But you have to understand...

983
01:04:34,151 --> 01:04:35,752
if it comes to saving you

984
01:04:35,754 --> 01:04:38,454
or the kid
or the Time Stone...

985
01:04:38,456 --> 01:04:42,191
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

986
01:04:42,193 --> 01:04:46,395
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

987
01:04:46,397 --> 01:04:49,300
Nice. Good, moral compass.

988
01:04:50,535 --> 01:04:52,136
We're straight.

989
01:04:53,237 --> 01:04:54,639
All right, kid.

990
01:04:55,874 --> 01:04:57,108
You're an Avenger now.

991
01:05:33,578 --> 01:05:35,813
I thought
you might be hungry.

992
01:05:47,925 --> 01:05:49,725
I always hated that chair.

993
01:05:49,727 --> 01:05:52,494
So I've been told.

994
01:05:52,496 --> 01:05:56,434
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

995
01:05:57,233 --> 01:05:58,669
I hated this room.

996
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:00,936
This ship.

997
01:06:00,938 --> 01:06:02,773
I hated my life.

998
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,513
You told me that too.

999
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:14,150
Every day.

1000
01:06:16,787 --> 01:06:18,756
For almost 20 years.

1001
01:06:21,391 --> 01:06:23,728
I was a child
when you took me.

1002
01:06:24,629 --> 01:06:25,896
I saved you.

1003
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:30,499
No.

1004
01:06:31,902 --> 01:06:35,671
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

1005
01:06:35,673 --> 01:06:37,405
Going to bed hungry...

1006
01:06:37,407 --> 01:06:39,307
scrounging for scraps.

1007
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:42,276
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1008
01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:44,713
I'm the one who stopped that.

1009
01:06:44,715 --> 01:06:46,715
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1010
01:06:46,717 --> 01:06:48,917
The children born...

1011
01:06:48,919 --> 01:06:52,553
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1012
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:53,758
It's a paradise.

1013
01:06:56,493 --> 01:06:58,526
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1014
01:06:58,528 --> 01:07:01,562
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1015
01:07:01,564 --> 01:07:02,697
You're insane.

1016
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:04,799
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1017
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:08,269
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1018
01:07:08,271 --> 01:07:12,607
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1019
01:07:12,609 --> 01:07:13,808
It needs correction.

1020
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:15,311
You don't know that!

1021
01:07:16,746 --> 01:07:19,614
I'm the only one
who knows that.

1022
01:07:19,616 --> 01:07:23,787
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1023
01:07:25,455 --> 01:07:26,456
For a time...

1024
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:33,329
you had that same will...

1025
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:37,333
as you fought by my side.

1026
01:07:38,035 --> 01:07:39,269
Daughter.

1027
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,738
I'm not your daughter.

1028
01:07:44,274 --> 01:07:46,876
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1029
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:49,310
And, in doing so,

1030
01:07:49,312 --> 01:07:51,514
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1031
01:07:54,451 --> 01:07:57,320
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

1032
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:03,491
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1033
01:08:04,627 --> 01:08:07,294
I am disappointed.

1034
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:09,666
But not because
you didn't find it.

1035
01:08:13,436 --> 01:08:14,938
But because you did.

1036
01:08:16,506 --> 01:08:18,307
And you lied.

1037
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:36,492
Nebula.

1038
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,099
Don't do this.

1039
01:08:45,101 --> 01:08:46,533
Some time ago,

1040
01:08:46,535 --> 01:08:49,436
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

1041
01:08:49,438 --> 01:08:50,504
Please don't do this.

1042
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:52,742
And very nearly succeeded.

1043
01:08:53,475 --> 01:08:54,844
So I brought her here.

1044
01:08:56,478 --> 01:08:57,679
To talk.

1045
01:09:05,387 --> 01:09:07,723
Stop. Stop it.

1046
01:09:13,629 --> 01:09:16,496
I swear to you on my life.

1047
01:09:16,498 --> 01:09:18,734
I never found the Soul Stone.

1048
01:09:22,838 --> 01:09:24,638
Accessing memory files.

1049
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,041
<i>You know
what he's about to do.</i>

1050
01:09:26,043 --> 01:09:28,842
<i>He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.</i>

1051
01:09:28,844 --> 01:09:30,045
<i>- All of them.
- He can never get them all.</i>

1052
01:09:30,047 --> 01:09:31,112
He will!

1053
01:09:31,114 --> 01:09:33,413
<i>He can't, Nebula.</i>

1054
01:09:33,415 --> 01:09:35,816
<i>Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...</i>

1055
01:09:35,818 --> 01:09:38,654
<i>and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.</i>

1056
01:09:43,692 --> 01:09:45,527
You're strong.

1057
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:48,564
Me.

1058
01:09:51,034 --> 01:09:52,701
You're generous.

1059
01:09:53,969 --> 01:09:54,970
Me.

1060
01:09:56,972 --> 01:09:59,639
But I never taught you to lie.

1061
01:09:59,641 --> 01:10:02,344
That's why
you're so bad at it.

1062
01:10:04,513 --> 01:10:08,951
Where is the Soul Stone?

1063
01:10:26,468 --> 01:10:27,469
Vormir!

1064
01:10:45,587 --> 01:10:47,055
The stone is on Vormir.

1065
01:10:50,491 --> 01:10:52,861
Show me.

1066
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:56,129
I am Groot.

1067
01:10:56,131 --> 01:10:57,496
Tinkle in the cup.

1068
01:10:57,498 --> 01:10:58,899
We're not looking.
What's there to see?

1069
01:10:58,901 --> 01:11:01,167
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.

1070
01:11:01,169 --> 01:11:02,568
I am Groot.

1071
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:03,669
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1072
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:05,504
out into space
and go in the cup again.

1073
01:11:05,506 --> 01:11:06,605
You speak Groot?

1074
01:11:06,607 --> 01:11:08,775
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

1075
01:11:08,777 --> 01:11:09,943
I am Groot.

1076
01:11:09,945 --> 01:11:12,078
You'll know when we're close.

1077
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,813
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1078
01:11:13,815 --> 01:11:15,984
the blazing power
of a neutron star.

1079
01:11:18,854 --> 01:11:20,855
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.

1080
01:11:21,622 --> 01:11:23,424
It's truly awesome.

1081
01:11:29,264 --> 01:11:32,566
Okay, time to be the captain.

1082
01:11:37,571 --> 01:11:39,738
So, dead brother, huh?

1083
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:42,008
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1084
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:43,911
Well, he's been dead before.

1085
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,281
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

1086
01:11:48,283 --> 01:11:50,883
And you said
your sister and your dad?

1087
01:11:50,885 --> 01:11:52,818
Both dead.

1088
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,954
But still got a mom, though?

1089
01:11:54,956 --> 01:11:56,289
Killed by a dark elf.

1090
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,589
A best friend?

1091
01:11:57,591 --> 01:11:58,859
Stabbed through the heart.

1092
01:12:02,163 --> 01:12:05,499
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

1093
01:12:07,702 --> 01:12:09,201
Absolutely.

1094
01:12:09,203 --> 01:12:12,938
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...

1095
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:14,673
they're all
tremendous motivators.

1096
01:12:14,675 --> 01:12:15,808
They really clear the mind.

1097
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:18,044
So I'm good to go.

1098
01:12:18,046 --> 01:12:20,746
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

1099
01:12:20,748 --> 01:12:23,115
he's the toughest there is.

1100
01:12:23,117 --> 01:12:25,284
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

1101
01:12:25,286 --> 01:12:27,619
He's never fought me twice.

1102
01:12:27,621 --> 01:12:29,555
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

1103
01:12:29,557 --> 01:12:31,759
It better be some hammer.

1104
01:12:35,863 --> 01:12:38,897
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1105
01:12:38,899 --> 01:12:41,066
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.

1106
01:12:41,068 --> 01:12:43,102
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

1107
01:12:43,104 --> 01:12:44,837
but none succeeded.

1108
01:12:44,839 --> 01:12:47,906
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

1109
01:12:47,908 --> 01:12:50,876
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

1110
01:12:50,878 --> 01:12:52,911
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

1111
01:12:52,913 --> 01:12:54,813
Fate wills it so.

1112
01:12:54,815 --> 01:12:56,148
Mmm-hmm.

1113
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:58,020
And what if you're wrong?

1114
01:13:01,255 --> 01:13:03,090
If I'm wrong, then...

1115
01:13:04,325 --> 01:13:05,960
what more could I lose?

1116
01:13:19,807 --> 01:13:21,173
I could lose a lot.

1117
01:13:21,175 --> 01:13:23,277
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.

1118
01:13:27,114 --> 01:13:28,115
Okay.

1119
01:13:31,185 --> 01:13:33,385
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

1120
01:13:33,387 --> 01:13:35,287
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

1121
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:37,755
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

1122
01:13:37,757 --> 01:13:40,359
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.

1123
01:13:40,361 --> 01:13:41,759
He gave you his eye?

1124
01:13:41,761 --> 01:13:42,995
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1125
01:13:42,997 --> 01:13:45,965
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

1126
01:13:47,901 --> 01:13:49,168
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1127
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:50,171
Hmm.

1128
01:13:52,806 --> 01:13:54,208
Huh?

1129
01:13:56,043 --> 01:13:57,342
Oh.

1130
01:13:57,344 --> 01:14:00,145
I would've washed that.

1131
01:14:00,147 --> 01:14:02,814
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...

1132
01:14:04,018 --> 01:14:05,085
Hey, we're here!

1133
01:14:09,089 --> 01:14:10,322
I don't think
this thing works.

1134
01:14:10,324 --> 01:14:11,658
Everything seems dark.

1135
01:14:14,028 --> 01:14:15,795
It ain't the eye.

1136
01:14:29,075 --> 01:14:30,377
Something's wrong.

1137
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:32,846
The star's gone out.

1138
01:14:33,947 --> 01:14:35,181
And the rings are frozen.

1139
01:14:56,302 --> 01:14:57,935
I hope
these dwarves are better

1140
01:14:57,937 --> 01:14:59,804
at forging
than they are cleaning.

1141
01:15:04,944 --> 01:15:06,477
Maybe they realized
that they live

1142
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:08,146
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.

1143
01:15:08,148 --> 01:15:11,117
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.

1144
01:15:13,353 --> 01:15:16,187
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?

1145
01:15:16,189 --> 01:15:17,455
Yes, why?

1146
01:15:17,457 --> 01:15:19,691
It look
anything like that?

1147
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:24,962
I am Groot.

1148
01:15:24,964 --> 01:15:26,366
Go back to the pod.

1149
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:31,404
Eitri, wait!

1150
01:15:32,405 --> 01:15:33,406
Stop!

1151
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:35,341
Stop.

1152
01:15:36,109 --> 01:15:37,110
Thor?

1153
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:42,213
What happened here?

1154
01:15:42,215 --> 01:15:45,383
You were supposed
to protect us.

1155
01:15:45,385 --> 01:15:48,219
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.

1156
01:15:48,221 --> 01:15:50,390
Asgard is destroyed.

1157
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:56,462
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?

1158
01:16:09,275 --> 01:16:12,278
300 dwarves
lived on this ring.

1159
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:16,715
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

1160
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:20,486
I made what he wanted.

1161
01:16:22,254 --> 01:16:26,725
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

1162
01:16:31,163 --> 01:16:33,832
Then he killed
everyone anyway.

1163
01:16:35,901 --> 01:16:37,736
All except me.

1164
01:16:38,804 --> 01:16:40,506
"Your life is yours," he said.

1165
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:46,876
"But your hands
are mine alone."

1166
01:16:46,878 --> 01:16:48,880
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.

1167
01:16:49,982 --> 01:16:51,515
Every weapon
you've ever designed,

1168
01:16:51,517 --> 01:16:53,183
every axe, hammer, sword...

1169
01:16:53,185 --> 01:16:56,253
it's all inside your head.

1170
01:16:56,255 --> 01:16:58,321
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.

1171
01:16:58,323 --> 01:17:00,323
Trust me, I know.

1172
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:05,097
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.

1173
01:17:45,504 --> 01:17:48,071
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1174
01:17:48,073 --> 01:17:50,242
I need you
to meet me on Titan.

1175
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:58,114
Hey, what's going on?

1176
01:17:58,116 --> 01:17:59,416
I think we're here.

1177
01:17:59,418 --> 01:18:01,986
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

1178
01:18:03,588 --> 01:18:05,288
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.

1179
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:06,325
Close those around it.

1180
01:18:08,059 --> 01:18:09,225
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.

1181
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:10,527
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta

1182
01:18:10,529 --> 01:18:12,290
- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.

1183
01:18:16,601 --> 01:18:18,100
- We might wanna turn.

1184
01:18:18,102 --> 01:18:19,304
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1185
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,868
You all right?

1186
01:18:51,703 --> 01:18:53,472
That was close.

1187
01:18:54,972 --> 01:18:56,573
I owe you one.

1188
01:18:56,575 --> 01:18:58,708
Let me just say, if aliens

1189
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:00,643
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...

1190
01:19:00,645 --> 01:19:01,678
and I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.

1191
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:04,413
I do not want another
single pop culture reference

1192
01:19:04,415 --> 01:19:06,148
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?

1193
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:07,830
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.

1194
01:19:15,059 --> 01:19:16,127
Thanos!

1195
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:39,048
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

1196
01:19:40,384 --> 01:19:42,953
- Stay down, clown.

1197
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:50,194
Die, blanket of death!

1198
01:19:56,133 --> 01:19:59,069
Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.

1199
01:20:00,237 --> 01:20:02,239
I'm gonna ask you
this one time.

1200
01:20:03,041 --> 01:20:04,373
Where is Gamora?

1201
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:07,209
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

1202
01:20:07,211 --> 01:20:10,179
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?

1203
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:12,181
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you

1204
01:20:12,183 --> 01:20:13,449
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.

1205
01:20:13,451 --> 01:20:17,051
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1206
01:20:17,053 --> 01:20:19,655
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1207
01:20:19,657 --> 01:20:21,790
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.

1208
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:24,158
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.

1209
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,260
I'll kill all three of you

1210
01:20:25,262 --> 01:20:27,262
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.

1211
01:20:27,264 --> 01:20:28,330
Starting with you.

1212
01:20:28,332 --> 01:20:29,264
Wait, what, Thanos?

1213
01:20:29,266 --> 01:20:32,133
All right, let me ask you
this one time.

1214
01:20:32,135 --> 01:20:33,802
What master do you serve?

1215
01:20:33,804 --> 01:20:35,269
What master do I serve?

1216
01:20:35,271 --> 01:20:36,640
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?

1217
01:20:37,608 --> 01:20:38,507
You're from Earth.

1218
01:20:38,509 --> 01:20:39,408
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.

1219
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:41,376
Yeah, that's on Earth,
dipshit.

1220
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:42,544
What are you hassling us for?

1221
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,347
So you're not
with Thanos?

1222
01:20:44,748 --> 01:20:47,248
With Thanos?

1223
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:50,051
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1224
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:52,588
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

1225
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:54,422
- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.

1226
01:20:54,424 --> 01:20:56,792
You're the ones
Thor told us about.

1227
01:20:56,794 --> 01:20:58,259
You know Thor?

1228
01:20:58,261 --> 01:20:59,227
Yeah.

1229
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:02,096
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.

1230
01:21:02,098 --> 01:21:03,634
Where is he now?

1231
01:21:18,682 --> 01:21:20,716
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

1232
01:21:20,718 --> 01:21:22,085
It's a mold.

1233
01:21:22,686 --> 01:21:24,652
A king's weapon.

1234
01:21:24,654 --> 01:21:27,622
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.

1235
01:21:27,624 --> 01:21:30,658
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1236
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,228
Did it have a name?

1237
01:21:33,429 --> 01:21:35,129
Stormbreaker.

1238
01:21:35,131 --> 01:21:36,232
That's a bit much.

1239
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:39,335
So how do we make it?

1240
01:21:41,204 --> 01:21:43,373
You'll have to restart
the forge.

1241
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,509
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

1242
01:21:49,212 --> 01:21:51,714
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1243
01:21:55,451 --> 01:21:57,552
The hell happened
to this planet?

1244
01:21:57,554 --> 01:21:59,453
It's eight degrees
off its axis.

1245
01:21:59,455 --> 01:22:01,624
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

1246
01:22:02,892 --> 01:22:06,694
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1247
01:22:06,696 --> 01:22:09,530
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

1248
01:22:09,532 --> 01:22:10,865
Or at least
the beginnings of one.

1249
01:22:10,867 --> 01:22:12,400
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

1250
01:22:12,402 --> 01:22:13,701
pin him down,
get what we need.

1251
01:22:13,703 --> 01:22:15,503
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

1252
01:22:15,505 --> 01:22:17,204
We just want the gauntlet.

1253
01:22:17,206 --> 01:22:19,574
- Are you yawning?

1254
01:22:19,576 --> 01:22:21,842
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1255
01:22:21,844 --> 01:22:23,678
Did you hear what I said?

1256
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,213
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

1257
01:22:26,215 --> 01:22:27,281
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

1258
01:22:27,283 --> 01:22:30,418
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1259
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,152
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?

1260
01:22:32,154 --> 01:22:33,754
Kick names, take ass.

1261
01:22:33,756 --> 01:22:35,157
Yeah, that's right.

1262
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:43,531
All right, just get over here,
please.

1263
01:22:43,533 --> 01:22:45,600
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

1264
01:22:45,602 --> 01:22:47,737
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1265
01:22:50,506 --> 01:22:51,872
We gotta coalesce.

1266
01:22:51,874 --> 01:22:53,708
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

1267
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:56,276
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1268
01:22:56,278 --> 01:22:57,745
We don't know what it means.

1269
01:22:57,747 --> 01:23:00,548
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

1270
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:03,249
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

1271
01:23:03,251 --> 01:23:05,318
and that way
it might be really good.

1272
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,420
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1273
01:23:07,422 --> 01:23:09,657
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.

1274
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:10,825
Like in <i>Footloose,</i> the movie?

1275
01:23:10,827 --> 01:23:12,760
Exactly like <i>Footloose.</i>

1276
01:23:12,762 --> 01:23:14,494
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

1277
01:23:14,496 --> 01:23:15,730
It never was.

1278
01:23:15,732 --> 01:23:16,831
Don't encourage this,
all right?

1279
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:18,331
- Okay.
- We're getting no help

1280
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:19,867
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

1281
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:21,636
By the way,
that's a compliment.

1282
01:23:21,638 --> 01:23:23,370
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1283
01:23:23,372 --> 01:23:24,807
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...

1284
01:23:25,975 --> 01:23:27,307
that's 100% you.

1285
01:23:27,309 --> 01:23:28,575
Your math
is blowing my mind.

1286
01:23:28,577 --> 01:23:29,812
Excuse me.

1287
01:23:30,813 --> 01:23:34,349
But does your friend
often do that?

1288
01:23:35,684 --> 01:23:37,920
Strange, we all right?

1289
01:23:48,363 --> 01:23:49,462
You're back. You're all right.

1290
01:23:49,464 --> 01:23:51,698
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?

1291
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:56,336
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1292
01:23:56,338 --> 01:23:57,837
To see all
the possible outcomes

1293
01:23:57,839 --> 01:23:59,708
of the coming conflict.

1294
01:24:00,509 --> 01:24:01,908
How many did you see?

1295
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:04,312
14,000,605.

1296
01:24:05,847 --> 01:24:07,382
How many did we win?

1297
01:24:11,987 --> 01:24:13,321
One.

1298
01:24:35,044 --> 01:24:38,246
The stone
had better be up there.

1299
01:24:39,948 --> 01:24:41,983
For your sister's sake.

1300
01:25:02,904 --> 01:25:07,709
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1301
01:25:09,778 --> 01:25:13,312
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1302
01:25:13,314 --> 01:25:14,581
You know us?

1303
01:25:14,583 --> 01:25:19,619
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1304
01:25:19,621 --> 01:25:21,355
Where is the Soul Stone?

1305
01:25:21,923 --> 01:25:24,389
You should know...

1306
01:25:24,391 --> 01:25:27,495
it extracts a terrible price.

1307
01:25:28,764 --> 01:25:30,431
I am prepared.

1308
01:25:32,801 --> 01:25:35,336
We all think that at first.

1309
01:25:39,775 --> 01:25:42,011
We are all wrong.

1310
01:25:53,687 --> 01:25:56,089
How is it you know
this place so well?

1311
01:25:56,091 --> 01:26:00,927
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

1312
01:26:00,929 --> 01:26:03,829
I even held one in my hand.

1313
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:08,002
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

1314
01:26:08,004 --> 01:26:12,041
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1315
01:26:20,815 --> 01:26:23,751
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1316
01:26:24,718 --> 01:26:26,821
As does what you fear.

1317
01:26:27,621 --> 01:26:29,588
What's this?

1318
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:31,157
The price.

1319
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:36,862
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1320
01:26:36,864 --> 01:26:40,935
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1321
01:26:42,436 --> 01:26:44,436
Tell me what it needs.

1322
01:26:44,438 --> 01:26:48,007
To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1323
01:26:48,009 --> 01:26:50,644
understands its power...

1324
01:26:51,612 --> 01:26:55,547
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1325
01:26:55,549 --> 01:26:57,516
Of what?

1326
01:26:57,518 --> 01:26:59,551
In order to take the stone,

1327
01:26:59,553 --> 01:27:01,889
you must lose
that which you love.

1328
01:27:04,825 --> 01:27:06,060
A soul...

1329
01:27:06,794 --> 01:27:07,995
for a soul.

1330
01:27:23,777 --> 01:27:26,047
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...

1331
01:27:27,015 --> 01:27:28,514
a moment...

1332
01:27:29,783 --> 01:27:31,852
when you got
what you deserved.

1333
01:27:34,022 --> 01:27:36,456
And I was always
so disappointed.

1334
01:27:39,927 --> 01:27:41,494
But now...

1335
01:27:45,465 --> 01:27:48,534
You kill and torture...

1336
01:27:50,503 --> 01:27:52,505
and you call it mercy.

1337
01:27:56,576 --> 01:27:58,645
The universe has judged you.

1338
01:28:00,114 --> 01:28:04,684
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1339
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,720
You failed.

1340
01:28:09,024 --> 01:28:10,925
And do you wanna know why?

1341
01:28:11,891 --> 01:28:13,760
Because you love nothing.

1342
01:28:14,527 --> 01:28:16,031
No one.

1343
01:28:21,734 --> 01:28:22,869
No.

1344
01:28:27,573 --> 01:28:28,574
Really?

1345
01:28:29,609 --> 01:28:30,677
Tears?

1346
01:28:31,511 --> 01:28:33,479
They're not for him.

1347
01:28:47,694 --> 01:28:48,861
No.

1348
01:28:50,264 --> 01:28:51,798
This isn't love.

1349
01:28:52,699 --> 01:28:55,234
I ignored my destiny once.

1350
01:28:57,804 --> 01:28:59,939
I cannot do that again.

1351
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:03,843
Even for you.

1352
01:29:28,002 --> 01:29:30,303
I'm sorry, little one.

1353
01:29:34,173 --> 01:29:35,574
No!

1354
01:31:13,071 --> 01:31:16,072
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1355
01:31:16,074 --> 01:31:17,407
I hope you're right
about this.

1356
01:31:17,409 --> 01:31:20,312
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.

1357
01:31:36,094 --> 01:31:37,460
When you said we were
going to open Wakanda

1358
01:31:37,462 --> 01:31:38,862
to the rest of the world...

1359
01:31:38,864 --> 01:31:41,164
this is not what I imagined.

1360
01:31:41,166 --> 01:31:43,266
And what did you imagine?

1361
01:31:43,268 --> 01:31:44,701
The Olympics.

1362
01:31:44,703 --> 01:31:46,304
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1363
01:32:00,485 --> 01:32:02,118
Should we bow?

1364
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,786
Yeah, he's a king.

1365
01:32:03,788 --> 01:32:05,789
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1366
01:32:06,925 --> 01:32:09,092
- What are you doing?

1367
01:32:09,094 --> 01:32:11,227
Uh, we don't do that here.

1368
01:32:11,229 --> 01:32:13,762
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1369
01:32:13,764 --> 01:32:16,900
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.

1370
01:32:16,902 --> 01:32:17,967
How we looking?

1371
01:32:17,969 --> 01:32:20,004
You will have my Kingsguard,

1372
01:32:20,006 --> 01:32:23,939
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...

1373
01:32:23,941 --> 01:32:26,877
And a semi-stable
100-year-old man.

1374
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:31,048
How you been, Buck?

1375
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:34,152
Uh, not bad,
for the end of the world.

1376
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:47,297
Whoa.

1377
01:32:47,299 --> 01:32:49,932
The structure is polymorphic.

1378
01:32:49,934 --> 01:32:53,168
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

1379
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:55,103
Why didn't you just reprogram

1380
01:32:55,105 --> 01:32:57,209
the synapses
to work collectively?

1381
01:32:58,276 --> 01:33:02,011
Because we didn't think of it.

1382
01:33:02,013 --> 01:33:03,379
I'm sure you did your best.

1383
01:33:03,381 --> 01:33:05,481
Can you do it?

1384
01:33:05,483 --> 01:33:09,051
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.

1385
01:33:09,053 --> 01:33:12,488
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

1386
01:33:12,490 --> 01:33:13,757
It will take time, brother.

1387
01:33:15,326 --> 01:33:16,426
How long?

1388
01:33:16,428 --> 01:33:17,859
As long as you can give me.

1389
01:33:22,333 --> 01:33:24,502
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

1390
01:33:41,385 --> 01:33:43,821
Hey, Cap, we got
a situation here.

1391
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:54,830
God, I love this place.

1392
01:33:54,832 --> 01:33:56,999
<i>Yeah, don't
start celebrating yet, guys.</i>

1393
01:33:57,002 --> 01:33:58,936
<i>We got more incoming
outside the dome.</i>

1394
01:34:18,122 --> 01:34:19,189
It's too late.

1395
01:34:20,224 --> 01:34:22,090
We need to destroy
the stone now.

1396
01:34:22,092 --> 01:34:23,925
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.

1397
01:34:23,927 --> 01:34:25,327
We will hold them off.

1398
01:34:25,329 --> 01:34:28,997
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...

1399
01:34:28,999 --> 01:34:30,001
you blow it to hell.

1400
01:34:30,334 --> 01:34:31,533
I will.

1401
01:34:31,535 --> 01:34:34,371
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.

1402
01:34:35,172 --> 01:34:36,540
And get this man a shield.

1403
01:34:47,083 --> 01:34:48,216
<i>I don't think</i>

1404
01:34:48,218 --> 01:34:49,584
<i>you get the scientifics here.</i>

1405
01:34:49,586 --> 01:34:52,154
<i>These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...</i>

1406
01:34:52,156 --> 01:34:53,522
<i>you're gonna need something
a lot bigger</i>

1407
01:34:53,524 --> 01:34:54,889
<i>to yank 'em loose.</i>

1408
01:34:54,891 --> 01:34:57,058
- Leave that to me.
- <i>Leave it to you?</i>

1409
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:00,228
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

1410
01:35:08,505 --> 01:35:09,571
<i>Fire the engines!</i>

1411
01:35:27,156 --> 01:35:29,892
More power, rabbit!

1412
01:36:01,257 --> 01:36:03,092
Well done, boy.

1413
01:36:04,728 --> 01:36:06,662
That's Nidavellir.

1414
01:36:26,716 --> 01:36:28,249
Damn it.

1415
01:36:28,251 --> 01:36:30,018
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

1416
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:31,419
The mechanism
is crippled.

1417
01:36:31,421 --> 01:36:33,021
- What?
- With the iris closed,

1418
01:36:33,023 --> 01:36:34,188
I can't heat the metal.

1419
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:35,990
How long will it take
to heat it?

1420
01:36:35,992 --> 01:36:38,294
A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?

1421
01:36:40,296 --> 01:36:41,462
I'm gonna hold it open.

1422
01:36:41,464 --> 01:36:42,696
That's suicide.

1423
01:36:42,698 --> 01:36:45,234
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

1424
01:36:55,076 --> 01:36:56,043
How we looking, Bruce?

1425
01:36:56,045 --> 01:36:57,979
Yeah, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.

1426
01:37:01,217 --> 01:37:03,350
Wow! This is amazing, man.

1427
01:37:03,352 --> 01:37:05,352
It's like being the Hulk
without actually...

1428
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:11,327
<i>I'm okay. I'm okay.</i>

1429
01:37:12,728 --> 01:37:13,794
I've got two heat signatures

1430
01:37:13,796 --> 01:37:14,996
breaking through
the tree line.

1431
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:46,059
Thank you
for standing with us.

1432
01:38:07,516 --> 01:38:09,817
Where's your other friend?

1433
01:38:09,819 --> 01:38:12,320
You will pay for his life
with yours.

1434
01:38:13,321 --> 01:38:16,289
Thanos will have that stone.

1435
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:17,791
That's not gonna happen.

1436
01:38:17,793 --> 01:38:20,360
You are in Wakanda now.

1437
01:38:20,362 --> 01:38:23,732
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.

1438
01:38:27,135 --> 01:38:29,102
We have blood to spare.

1439
01:38:40,382 --> 01:38:41,816
They surrender?

1440
01:38:42,651 --> 01:38:43,716
Not exactly.

1441
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:12,213
What the hell?

1442
01:39:15,182 --> 01:39:16,749
Looks like we pissed her off.

1443
01:39:27,495 --> 01:39:29,129
They're killing themselves.

1444
01:40:05,332 --> 01:40:06,866
You see the teeth
on those things?

1445
01:40:06,868 --> 01:40:07,934
All right, back up, Sam.

1446
01:40:07,936 --> 01:40:09,297
You're gonna get
your wings singed.

1447
01:40:21,548 --> 01:40:22,949
Cap, if these things
circle the perimeter

1448
01:40:22,951 --> 01:40:24,083
and get in behind us...

1449
01:40:24,085 --> 01:40:26,451
there's nothing
between them and Vision.

1450
01:40:26,453 --> 01:40:28,420
Then we better keep 'em
in front of us.

1451
01:40:28,422 --> 01:40:29,690
How do we do that?

1452
01:40:31,993 --> 01:40:33,694
We open the barrier.

1453
01:40:35,897 --> 01:40:40,465
On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.

1454
01:40:40,467 --> 01:40:42,434
<i>Requesting
confirmation, My King.</i>

1455
01:40:42,436 --> 01:40:44,302
<i>You said open the barrier?</i>

1456
01:40:44,304 --> 01:40:45,671
On my signal.

1457
01:40:45,673 --> 01:40:47,574
This will be
the end of Wakanda.

1458
01:40:48,842 --> 01:40:52,379
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.

1459
01:41:05,259 --> 01:41:06,792
Wakanda forever!

1460
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:20,274
Now!

1461
01:41:50,537 --> 01:41:52,004
How much longer, Shuri?

1462
01:41:52,006 --> 01:41:53,772
I've barely begun, brother.

1463
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:55,642
You might want to pick up
the pace

1464
01:42:02,683 --> 01:42:04,716
Allfathers, give me strength.

1465
01:42:04,718 --> 01:42:06,685
You understand, boy?

1466
01:42:06,687 --> 01:42:09,690
You're about to take
the full force of a star.

1467
01:42:10,657 --> 01:42:12,724
It'll kill you.

1468
01:42:12,726 --> 01:42:14,895
Only if I die.

1469
01:42:15,328 --> 01:42:16,728
Yes.

1470
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:19,532
That's what killing you means.

1471
01:42:47,527 --> 01:42:49,462
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1472
01:43:39,846 --> 01:43:41,814
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1473
01:43:42,748 --> 01:43:43,749
Thor, you okay?

1474
01:43:49,488 --> 01:43:50,855
I think he's dying.

1475
01:43:50,857 --> 01:43:52,825
He needs the axe!

1476
01:43:54,193 --> 01:43:55,661
Where's the handle?

1477
01:43:58,698 --> 01:44:00,967
Tree, help me find the handle!

1478
01:45:09,868 --> 01:45:12,038
There's too many of 'em!

1479
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:41,965
You guys
are so screwed now!

1480
01:45:45,203 --> 01:45:47,270
Bring me Thanos!

1481
01:46:20,006 --> 01:46:21,605
Oh, yeah.

1482
01:46:24,709 --> 01:46:26,711
You're much more of a Thanos.

1483
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:31,116
I take it the Maw is dead.

1484
01:46:33,351 --> 01:46:35,920
This day
extracts a heavy toll.

1485
01:46:37,688 --> 01:46:40,189
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

1486
01:46:40,191 --> 01:46:41,793
You may regret that.

1487
01:46:42,659 --> 01:46:44,028
He brought you face-to-face

1488
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:45,562
with the Master
of the Mystic Arts.

1489
01:46:48,699 --> 01:46:51,069
And where do you think
he brought you?

1490
01:46:52,137 --> 01:46:54,906
Let me guess. Your home?

1491
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:00,644
It was.

1492
01:47:03,248 --> 01:47:04,782
And it was beautiful.

1493
01:47:07,285 --> 01:47:09,985
Titan was like most planets.

1494
01:47:09,987 --> 01:47:13,022
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1495
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:16,227
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1496
01:47:17,228 --> 01:47:19,162
Genocide.

1497
01:47:19,164 --> 01:47:23,234
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

1498
01:47:24,701 --> 01:47:27,403
They called me a madman.

1499
01:47:27,405 --> 01:47:29,807
And what I predicted
came to pass.

1500
01:47:32,377 --> 01:47:34,578
Congratulations,
you're a prophet.

1501
01:47:35,046 --> 01:47:36,345
I'm a survivor.

1502
01:47:36,347 --> 01:47:38,847
Who wants to murder trillions.

1503
01:47:38,849 --> 01:47:43,051
With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

1504
01:47:43,053 --> 01:47:47,825
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1505
01:47:49,893 --> 01:47:51,295
And then what?

1506
01:47:52,763 --> 01:47:54,996
I'd finally rest...

1507
01:47:54,998 --> 01:47:59,234
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1508
01:47:59,236 --> 01:48:03,738
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1509
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:08,312
I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.

1510
01:48:09,847 --> 01:48:10,848
Our?

1511
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,386
Piece of cake, Quill.

1512
01:48:18,388 --> 01:48:20,791
Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.

1513
01:48:58,929 --> 01:49:00,295
Boom!

1514
01:49:00,297 --> 01:49:03,066
- Don't let him close his fist.

1515
01:49:07,237 --> 01:49:08,238
Magic.

1516
01:49:08,938 --> 01:49:09,939
More magic.

1517
01:49:10,806 --> 01:49:11,807
Magic with a kick.

1518
01:49:12,309 --> 01:49:13,310
Magic with a...

1519
01:49:14,777 --> 01:49:16,013
- Insect!

1520
01:49:53,350 --> 01:49:54,782
Well, well.

1521
01:49:54,784 --> 01:49:55,950
You should've killed me.

1522
01:49:55,952 --> 01:49:57,785
It would've been
a waste of parts!

1523
01:50:03,226 --> 01:50:04,391
Where's Gamora?

1524
01:50:45,601 --> 01:50:46,967
Is he under?
Don't let up.

1525
01:50:46,969 --> 01:50:49,603
Be quick. He is very strong.

1526
01:50:49,605 --> 01:50:51,972
Parker, help! Get over here.

1527
01:50:51,974 --> 01:50:54,243
She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.

1528
01:50:59,615 --> 01:51:00,948
We gotta open
his fingers to get it off.

1529
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:02,116
I thought you'd be
hard to catch.

1530
01:51:02,118 --> 01:51:03,398
For the record,
this was my plan.

1531
01:51:04,553 --> 01:51:06,322
You're not so strong now, huh?

1532
01:51:06,922 --> 01:51:08,589
Where is Gamora?

1533
01:51:08,591 --> 01:51:10,890
My Gamora.

1534
01:51:10,892 --> 01:51:13,160
No, bullshit!

1535
01:51:13,162 --> 01:51:14,397
Where is she?

1536
01:51:15,464 --> 01:51:16,898
He is in anguish.

1537
01:51:17,466 --> 01:51:19,533
- Good.

1538
01:51:19,535 --> 01:51:22,436
He... He mourns.

1539
01:51:22,438 --> 01:51:26,142
What does
this monster have to mourn?

1540
01:51:26,908 --> 01:51:27,976
Gamora.

1541
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:33,213
What?

1542
01:51:33,215 --> 01:51:35,316
He took her to Vormir.

1543
01:51:35,318 --> 01:51:37,286
He came back
with the Soul Stone.

1544
01:51:38,119 --> 01:51:39,522
But she didn't.

1545
01:51:41,457 --> 01:51:45,492
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?

1546
01:51:45,494 --> 01:51:49,064
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1547
01:51:50,266 --> 01:51:51,267
Tell me she's lying.

1548
01:51:53,636 --> 01:51:56,472
Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!

1549
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:01,377
I had to.

1550
01:52:02,177 --> 01:52:03,577
No, you didn't.

1551
01:52:03,579 --> 01:52:05,414
- No, you didn't.

1552
01:52:09,284 --> 01:52:10,684
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1553
01:52:10,686 --> 01:52:13,286
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!

1554
01:52:13,288 --> 01:52:14,521
- <i>Hey, stop! Stop!</i>

1555
01:52:14,523 --> 01:52:16,764
It's coming, it's
coming. I got it, I got it!

1556
01:52:19,961 --> 01:52:20,962
Oh, God.

1557
01:53:19,354 --> 01:53:23,055
Come and get some,
space dogs!

1558
01:53:25,693 --> 01:53:28,494
Come on! Get some! Get some!

1559
01:53:28,496 --> 01:53:30,630
Come on! Get some!

1560
01:53:30,632 --> 01:53:33,366
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1561
01:53:33,368 --> 01:53:35,270
Okay. How much for the arm?

1562
01:53:37,172 --> 01:53:39,238
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1563
01:53:48,081 --> 01:53:49,382
New haircut?

1564
01:53:49,384 --> 01:53:50,618
Noticed you've copied
my beard.

1565
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:55,122
By the way, this is
a friend of mine, Tree.

1566
01:53:56,056 --> 01:53:57,991
I am Groot.

1567
01:53:58,793 --> 01:54:00,693
I am Steve Rogers.

1568
01:54:20,414 --> 01:54:22,550
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1569
01:54:32,092 --> 01:54:34,326
Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.

1570
01:54:34,328 --> 01:54:35,429
I'm doing it.

1571
01:54:59,353 --> 01:55:01,054
Why was she up there
all this time?

1572
01:55:01,823 --> 01:55:04,725
She's on the field. Take it.

1573
01:55:36,423 --> 01:55:38,590
Guys, we got
a Vision situation here.

1574
01:55:41,328 --> 01:55:43,428
Somebody get to Vision!

1575
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:45,265
- I got him!</i>
- On my way.

1576
01:55:50,571 --> 01:55:53,572
He'll die alone. As will you.

1577
01:55:53,574 --> 01:55:54,808
She's not alone.

1578
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:22,901
Oh, no, you don't.

1579
01:56:22,903 --> 01:56:24,603
This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.

1580
01:56:24,605 --> 01:56:27,171
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.

1581
01:56:27,173 --> 01:56:28,238
<i>What? No! No!</i>

1582
01:56:31,778 --> 01:56:34,548
<i>Guys!
Vision needs backup, now!</i>

1583
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:38,282
Hulk? Hulk,

1584
01:56:38,284 --> 01:56:40,351
I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.

1585
01:56:40,353 --> 01:56:42,856
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.

1586
01:56:47,426 --> 01:56:48,862
Hulk! Hulk!

1587
01:56:49,763 --> 01:56:50,764
Hulk!

1588
01:56:51,898 --> 01:56:54,365
No!

1589
01:56:54,367 --> 01:56:57,301
Oh, screw
you, you big, green asshole!

1590
01:56:57,303 --> 01:56:58,471
I'll do it myself!

1591
01:56:59,405 --> 01:57:01,273
<i>Come on! Yeah!</i>

1592
01:57:13,552 --> 01:57:15,285
- See ya!

1593
01:57:26,666 --> 01:57:29,333
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

1594
01:57:40,312 --> 01:57:42,214
I thought you were formidable,
machine.

1595
01:57:42,982 --> 01:57:45,618
But you're dying,
like any man.

1596
01:57:54,293 --> 01:57:55,494
Get outta here!

1597
01:57:58,831 --> 01:57:59,865
Go!

1598
01:58:18,651 --> 01:58:20,386
That was really gross.

1599
01:58:47,512 --> 01:58:48,592
I thought I told you to go.

1600
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:52,018
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1601
01:59:03,428 --> 01:59:05,661
I got you. I got you.

1602
01:59:05,663 --> 01:59:07,665
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.

1603
01:59:52,877 --> 01:59:54,544
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1604
01:59:56,548 --> 01:59:59,484
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1605
02:00:02,821 --> 02:00:03,886
A fake.

1606
02:00:11,796 --> 02:00:15,498
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.

1607
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:16,766
Stark.

1608
02:00:16,768 --> 02:00:17,836
You know me?

1609
02:00:18,536 --> 02:00:20,069
I do.

1610
02:00:20,071 --> 02:00:23,374
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

1611
02:00:24,108 --> 02:00:25,577
My only curse is you.

1612
02:00:28,047 --> 02:00:29,048
Come on!

1613
02:00:57,009 --> 02:00:58,977
All that for a drop of blood.

1614
02:01:43,022 --> 02:01:44,855
You have my respect, Stark.

1615
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:49,760
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

1616
02:01:55,166 --> 02:01:57,434
I hope they remember you.

1617
02:02:07,077 --> 02:02:08,178
Stop.

1618
02:02:14,618 --> 02:02:15,619
Spare his life...

1619
02:02:17,254 --> 02:02:19,056
and I will give you the stone.

1620
02:02:22,693 --> 02:02:23,927
No tricks.

1621
02:02:28,765 --> 02:02:29,766
Don't.

1622
02:03:21,118 --> 02:03:22,886
One to go.

1623
02:03:32,795 --> 02:03:34,131
Where is he?

1624
02:03:43,106 --> 02:03:44,607
Did we just lose?

1625
02:03:48,345 --> 02:03:50,280
Why would you do that?

1626
02:03:53,749 --> 02:03:55,951
We're in the endgame now.

1627
02:04:20,776 --> 02:04:23,344
Are you okay?

1628
02:04:25,247 --> 02:04:27,081
What? What is it?

1629
02:04:29,151 --> 02:04:30,252
He's here.

1630
02:04:41,263 --> 02:04:44,300
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.

1631
02:04:47,103 --> 02:04:49,071
What the hell?

1632
02:05:14,697 --> 02:05:15,698
Cap.

1633
02:05:16,298 --> 02:05:17,867
That's him.

1634
02:05:19,902 --> 02:05:22,371
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1635
02:05:46,962 --> 02:05:47,963
Wanda.

1636
02:05:49,064 --> 02:05:50,430
It's time.

1637
02:05:50,432 --> 02:05:51,764
No.

1638
02:05:51,766 --> 02:05:54,067
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.

1639
02:05:54,069 --> 02:05:55,735
Look at me.

1640
02:05:55,737 --> 02:05:56,936
You have the power
to destroy the stone.

1641
02:05:56,938 --> 02:05:58,005
Don't.

1642
02:05:58,007 --> 02:05:59,207
You must do it. Wanda, please.

1643
02:06:01,110 --> 02:06:03,778
We are out of time.

1644
02:06:04,413 --> 02:06:05,845
I can't.

1645
02:06:05,847 --> 02:06:07,183
Yes, you can.

1646
02:06:07,916 --> 02:06:09,118
You can.

1647
02:06:10,519 --> 02:06:12,954
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

1648
02:06:15,257 --> 02:06:16,858
It's not fair.

1649
02:06:18,027 --> 02:06:19,694
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.

1650
02:06:21,463 --> 02:06:23,032
It's all right.

1651
02:06:24,366 --> 02:06:26,134
You could never hurt me.

1652
02:06:35,176 --> 02:06:37,012
I just feel you.

1653
02:08:00,128 --> 02:08:01,229
It's all right.

1654
02:08:11,172 --> 02:08:12,440
It's all right.

1655
02:08:16,910 --> 02:08:17,978
I love you.

1656
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:49,343
I understand, my child.

1657
02:08:50,977 --> 02:08:52,480
Better than anyone.

1658
02:08:54,214 --> 02:08:56,149
You could never.

1659
02:09:01,022 --> 02:09:04,025
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1660
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:08,362
But now is no time to mourn.

1661
02:09:10,565 --> 02:09:14,568
Now is no time at all.

1662
02:09:38,025 --> 02:09:39,026
No!

1663
02:10:37,017 --> 02:10:38,385
I told you...

1664
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:41,555
you'd die for that.

1665
02:10:56,036 --> 02:10:57,637
You should have...

1666
02:11:00,339 --> 02:11:01,708
You should...

1667
02:11:04,310 --> 02:11:07,514
You should have
gone for the head.

1668
02:11:09,448 --> 02:11:10,449
No!

1669
02:11:43,782 --> 02:11:45,150
Daughter?

1670
02:11:52,658 --> 02:11:54,159
Did you do it?

1671
02:11:56,095 --> 02:11:57,096
Yes.

1672
02:12:05,437 --> 02:12:07,106
What did it cost?

1673
02:12:10,676 --> 02:12:12,278
Everything.

1674
02:12:22,488 --> 02:12:24,123
What did you do?

1675
02:12:25,324 --> 02:12:26,725
What'd you do?

1676
02:12:40,439 --> 02:12:41,740
Where'd he go?

1677
02:12:44,677 --> 02:12:45,842
Thor.

1678
02:12:49,180 --> 02:12:50,814
Where'd he go?

1679
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:52,216
Steve?

1680
02:13:26,885 --> 02:13:29,786
Up, General. Up!

1681
02:13:29,788 --> 02:13:31,387
This is no place to die.

1682
02:13:46,371 --> 02:13:47,904
I am Groot.

1683
02:13:47,906 --> 02:13:49,540
- Oh...

1684
02:13:50,441 --> 02:13:52,510
No, no, no!

1685
02:13:53,378 --> 02:13:56,247
Groot! No.

1686
02:14:09,594 --> 02:14:10,728
Sam!

1687
02:14:14,766 --> 02:14:16,467
Sam, where you at?

1688
02:14:25,743 --> 02:14:27,912
Something's happening.

1689
02:14:40,025 --> 02:14:41,359
Quill?

1690
02:14:48,666 --> 02:14:49,932
Steady, Quill.

1691
02:14:49,934 --> 02:14:51,234
Oh, man.

1692
02:14:55,373 --> 02:14:56,374
Tony.

1693
02:14:59,811 --> 02:15:02,380
There was no other way.

1694
02:15:07,919 --> 02:15:08,920
Mr. Stark?

1695
02:15:13,491 --> 02:15:14,759
I don't feel so good.

1696
02:15:16,828 --> 02:15:17,727
You're all right.

1697
02:15:17,729 --> 02:15:19,029
I don't... I don't know
what's happening.

1698
02:15:19,031 --> 02:15:20,665
I don't know...

1699
02:15:22,466 --> 02:15:23,599
I don't want to go.

1700
02:15:23,601 --> 02:15:25,500
I don't want to go, sir.
Please.

1701
02:15:25,502 --> 02:15:28,271
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

1702
02:15:32,710 --> 02:15:34,311
I'm sorry.

1703
02:15:48,993 --> 02:15:50,560
He did it.

1704
02:16:15,385 --> 02:16:18,555
What is this?
What the hell is happening?

1705
02:16:35,472 --> 02:16:37,073
Oh, God.

1706
02:27:33,425 --> 02:27:35,025
Still no word
from Stark?

1707
02:27:35,027 --> 02:27:36,358
No, not yet.

1708
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:37,461
<i>We're watching every satellite</i>

1709
02:27:37,463 --> 02:27:39,629
<i>on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.</i>

1710
02:27:39,631 --> 02:27:41,731
- What is it?

1711
02:27:41,733 --> 02:27:44,333
Multiple bogeys
over Wakanda.

1712
02:27:44,335 --> 02:27:46,402
Same energy signature
as New York?

1713
02:27:46,404 --> 02:27:47,673
Ten times bigger.

1714
02:27:49,273 --> 02:27:50,439
Tell Klein
we'll meet him at...

1715
02:27:50,441 --> 02:27:51,541
- Nick! Nick!

1716
02:28:05,189 --> 02:28:06,424
They okay?

1717
02:28:07,425 --> 02:28:09,291
There's no one here.

1718
02:28:18,669 --> 02:28:20,271
Call Control.

1719
02:28:21,072 --> 02:28:22,306
Code red.

1720
02:28:22,841 --> 02:28:24,042
Nick.

1721
02:28:25,576 --> 02:28:26,577
Hill.

1722
02:28:41,526 --> 02:28:42,660
Oh, no.

1723
02:28:44,362 --> 02:28:45,363
Mother...
