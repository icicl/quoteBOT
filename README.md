# quoteBOT
**About this branch**

quoteBot is an original Discord bot that get screenshots from the 2005 movie, Star Wars: Episode III â€“ Revenge of the Sith. The code is written entirely in JavaScript using discord.js, other than an SRT to JSON converter that was written in Python 3.

This bot was made to have a single function: quote Star Wars Movies.

### Commands

The only command used by quoteBOT is ";quote <quote here>" and will display an image corresponding to the quote. 
  
If the quote is not accurate, or there are typos within it, the bot will use a [Levenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) Algorithm to find the most similar quote within the database.

### TO-DO

Add more movies to the database for a larger query to sample from.

Rewrite wiki and document sampling function
